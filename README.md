## To-Do-List Fullstack Application
This fullstack application allows users to keep track of any tasks, or chores that they add to the list. Users are able to check off tasks that are completed and can also delete tasks when completed. 

## Languages Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, Mongodb

## Lessons Learned
With this app it helped establish my understanding of how to build complete applications. By taking a previous porject that was static and updating and connecting it to a server and database, I have a much better grasp of how to implement the backend of my applications.
